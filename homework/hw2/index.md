# CS142: Homework 2

Homework problems are intended to give you more practice with shorter programs than the larger "projects" do.
Typically these problems will also give you an idea of what you might see on tests.  You also get immediate
feedback.

This is another CodeCheck homework.  If you've forgotten how this works, look at homework 1.

[Here's the link for the assignment.](https://codecheck.io/assignment/24100220508s7tembxtdawnz49l7rk6dgcs)

When you're all done, paste your CodeCheck ID into the Canvas assignment and submit it.
